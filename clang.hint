sdesc: "C/C++/ObjC compiler frontend based on LLVM"
ldesc: "Clang is an LLVM native C/C++/ObjC compiler, which aims to 
deliver amazingly fast compiles, extremely useful error and warning 
messages and to provide a platform for building great source level 
tools. The Clang Static Analyzer is a tool that automatically finds bugs 
in your code, and is a great example of the sort of tool that can be 
built using the Clang frontend as a library to parse C/C++ code."
